# deploy-mern-app-1

I have done most of the work on the page Program which you will find on the navbaar 

there are two main folder frontend and backend 

**For Backend**

step1: after cloning the file first go to the directory backend 
step2: open the terminal write npm install
step3: after installing write npm start 
then backend server will start to run 

For frontend

step1: after cloning the file first go to the directory frontend
step2: open the terminal write npm install
step3: after installing write npm start then you will redirect to the web browser 

and now you can see the code which I have done
